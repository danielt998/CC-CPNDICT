# CC-CPNDICT
Chinese Proper Noun Dictionary

This project aims to be a (Mandarin) proper noun dictionary, similar to [ENAMDICT|http://www.edrdg.org/enamdict/enamdict_doc.html] for Japanese, and should be able to act as a supplement to CC-CEDICT.

Items will be in the following format (subject to change):
  TRAD SIMP [PINYIN] /english def 1/ english def 2/ {Wikidata Item}
Note every entry should have a Wikidata item as this will allow us to do lots of cool things in the future.
